# Floating Hull Simulation

This simulation allows students to explore how hull shape, size, and load affect buoyancy.

## How to Use
- Choose a hull shape (Rectangle, Triangle, Semi-circle)
- Adjust width, depth, and the load using sliders
- Observe whether the hull floats or sinks
- Discuss predictions and outcomes

## Concepts Covered
- Archimedesâ€™ Principle
- Density and buoyant force
- Pressure and distribution of force
